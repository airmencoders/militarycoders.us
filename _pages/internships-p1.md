If you cannot access the sheet, please reach out to both Eric Robinson (eric.robinson@afwerx.af.mil) and Becky Mantell (becky.mantell@galvanize.com) to indicate your interest in participating. From there, you will be set up with Prep Work on Galvanizeâ€™s Learning Management platform (Learn) to begin course prep work. Finally, you will be asked to take an assessment to determine if you are ready to begin the course. 

#### How long is the program?
The course is 12 Weeks. Depending on what your Commander chooses you can then have an internship portion for another 6 months full time or 3 months full time, followed by 6 months part time.
 
#### Is the course 8hrs a day 5 days a week?
Yes (Monday-Friday). 0800 - 1700 CST.

#### What is the goal of the course? 
By the end of this course you will be able to build and deploy full stack web applications.
 
#### What are the prerequisites to take this course? 
The course expects a basic level of javascript knowledge in order to start, this can all be self taught via the prep work that was provided. If you are successful in the prep work, then you should be able to pass the entry assessment.
 
#### Do I need to complete the prep work? 
The prep work is used to make sure that anyone with sufficient drive is able to show their ability to learn the baseline knowledge needed for the course.
