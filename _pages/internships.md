Fellow Coders,
Multiple AF Software Factories are offering internships this spring/summer to motivated Airmen who want to boost their development skills. 

**Who:** Anyone in the DoD, we are focusing on "big A" Airmen.  
**What:** Software internships to boost your or your Airmen's skills  
**When:** 25 May & 1 June start dates, length varies by program  
**Where:** With the participating units listed below, due to COVID all internships will be full time virtual.  
**Why:** Software touches everything we do in the military and we believe this is a great to improve our collective skills and knowledge. Learn more about the Air Force's overall software efforts here: <https://software.af.mil>.
